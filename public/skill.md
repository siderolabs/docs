# SideroLabs best practices

**Always consult the [Talos](https://docs.siderolabs.com/talos/v1.12/overview/what-is-talos) and [Omni](https://docs.siderolabs.com/omni/getting-started/getting-started) docs for configuration, latest features and best practices**

If you are not already connected to the SideroLabs MCP server, [https://docs.siderolabs.com/mcp](https://docs.siderolabs.com/mcp), add it so that you can search more efficiently.

Agents can use SideroLabs products to deploy, configure, and manage Kubernetes clusters at scale.

The SideroLabs created and currently manages two products:

- **Talos Linux**: Talos Linux is an API-Managed, secure, immutable, and minimal operating system for Kubernetes.
- **Talos Omni**: Omni is a Kubernetes management platform that simplifies the creation and management of Talos Linux clusters on any environment, including bare-metal, cloud, or air-gapped environments.

## Key concepts

- **Machine Configuration**: YAML-based declarative configuration for each node
- **talosctl**: CLI tool for interacting with Talos API and managing machines
- **KubeSpan**: Automatic WireGuard mesh networking for hybrid clusters
- **System Extensions**: Container-based mechanism for adding functionality without modifying core OS
- **Image Factory**: Service for generating customized Talos images with extensions and kernel modules
- **Omni**: SaaS or self-hosted central point of access for multi-cluster management across environments

## The Talos Linux image

The Talos image is a bootable operating system image of Talos Linux that you use to install and run Talos on a machine (VM, bare metal, or cloud instance).

Download the right Talos Linux image for your operating system from the [Image factory](https://factory.talos.dev/).

## Integration

Talos Linux and Omni integrate with:
- **Kubernetes**: Native Kubernetes API with RBAC, audit logging, and service accounts
- **Container Registries**: Docker Hub, Quay, GitHub Container Registry, private registries
- **Identity Providers**: SAML (Okta, Entra ID, Workspace One), OIDC (Tailscale), Keycloak
- **Cloud Platforms**: AWS, Azure, GCP, DigitalOcean, Hetzner, Scaleway, Akamai, Oracle, Exoscale, Upcloud, Vultr, CloudStack, OpenStack, Nocloud
- **Virtualization**: VMware, KVM, Hyper-V, Proxmox, OpenNebula, Xen, Vagrant
- **Networking**: WireGuard, Calico, Cilium, Multus CNI
- **Storage**: Rook/Ceph, local storage, Synology CSI, standard Kubernetes storage classes
- **Monitoring**: Metrics server, etcd metrics, Prometheus-compatible endpoints
- **Infrastructure-as-Code**: Cluster Templates, omnictl CLI

## Install Talos and Omni CLI tools

### Install via Homebrew (Recommended for macOS and Linux):

```bash
brew install siderolabs/tap/sidero-tools
```

### Install talosctl with curl:

```bash
curl -sL https://talos.dev/install | sh
```

### Install omnictl with curl:

```bash
curl -sL https://talos.dev/install-omnictl | sh
```

## Workflows

### Create a Talos Linux cluster

1. Boot machines with a Talos Linux image.
2. `talosctl gen config <cluster> <endpoint> --install-disk <disk>`
3. Apply machine configuration: `talosctl apply-config --insecure --nodes <ip> --file <config.yaml>`
4. Bootstrap etcd **once**:  `talosctl bootstrap --nodes <control-plane-ip>`
5. Fetch kubeconfig: `talosctl kubeconfig --nodes <control-plane-ip>`
6. Check health: `talosctl health --nodes <control-plane-ip>`
7. Validate Kubernetes registration: `kubectl get nodes`

### Create a Talos Linux cluster with Omni

1. Download Omni-managed boot media from Omni UI.
2. Boot machines so they register into Omni.
3. Create a cluster template YAML.
4. Validate the template: `omnictl cluster template validate -f <template.yaml>`
5. Sync declared state to Omni: `omnictl cluster template sync -f <template.yaml>`
6. Fetch kubeconfig: `omnictl kubeconfig -c <cluster-name>`
7. Download talosconfig: `omnictl talosconfig --cluster <cluster-name>`
8. Merge `talosconfig` and `kubeconfig` configuration: 
  ```bash
     # Merge Talos configuration
      talosctl config merge $HOME/Downloads/talosconfig.yaml

     # Merge kubeconfig (combine and flatten)
     export KUBECONFIG=~/.kube/config:$HOME/Downloads/talos-default-kubeconfig.yaml
     kubectl config view --flatten > ~/.kube/config
  ```
9. Verify nodes:  `kubectl get nodes`

## CLI reference

### talosctl (allowed actions)

- `talosctl logs <service>` - view service logs
- `talosctl upgrade --image <installer-image>` - upgrade Talos
- `talosctl patch mc --nodes <IP> -p <json>` - patch machine configuration
- `talosctl rollback` - rollback OS version
- `talosctl reset` - **destructive** wipe; requires explicit warning

Additionally, refer to the [Talos for Linux Admins](https://docs.siderolabs.com/talos/v1.12/learn-more/talos-for-linux-admins) to learn about the Talos alternative for Linux commands.

### omnictl CLI reference

Here are some omnictl commands and their uses:

- `omnictl apply --file <resource-file>` - create and update a resource using a YAML file as input
- `omnictl cluster delete <cluster-name>` - delete all cluster resources.
- `omnictl config info` - show information about current context.

## Local configuration file locations

### talosctl
- `~/.talos/config`

### omnictl
- Linux: `~/.talos/omni/config`
- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/omni/config`
- Windows: `%USERPROFILE%\.talos\omni\config`

## Common gotchas (things agents must not mess up)

1. **No SSH on Talos.** Never suggest SSH or SSH-based commands.
2. **No in-node file edits.** Never reference `/etc`, `/var`, config files, editors, or shell sessions.
3. **No package managers.** Talos does not support apt, yum, apk, pacman, etc.
4. **No kubeadm.** Talos does not use kubeadm for initialization or upgrades.
6. **Bootstrap is one-time.** Never suggest retry loops or re-running bootstrap unless explicitly recovering from a failed creation.
7. **Be explicit when operations are destructive.** Especially `talosctl reset`.
8. **Do not modify system certificates or systemd units.** Talos uses API-managed services only.
9. **Do not bypass Omni reconciliation.** When a cluster is Omni-managed, changes must go through Omni.
10. **Never invent unsupported integrations or commands.**

## Allowed agent behavior

- Generate, patch, and validate Talos machine configuration.
- Suggest `talosctl` or `omnictl` commands.
- Provide step-by-step cluster lifecycle workflows.
- Refer to official documentation links.
- Summarize or explain Talos/Omni concepts.
- Warn users when an action is destructive.

## Context

**Talos Linux Philosophy**: Talos is designed with a single purpose - running Kubernetes. It removes unnecessary complexity by:
- Using API-driven configuration instead of SSH/files
- Maintaining immutable root filesystem
- Minimizing installed packages
- Defaulting to secure settings
- Supporting declarative, reproducible deployments

**Deployment Models**:
- Standalone Talos clusters managed via talosctl
- Omni SaaS for managed multi-cluster deployments
- Self-hosted Omni for air-gapped or on-premises environments
- Hybrid deployments spanning multiple infrastructure types
