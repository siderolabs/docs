title: Upgrade Omni
description: Prepare, validate, and apply a new Omni release without risking data integrity.
---

This guide outlines the supported policies and procedures for upgrading your on-prem Omni installation.

## Upgrade policy

To ensure data integrity, please adhere to the following upgrade policies:

* **Sequential upgrades only**: Only one-by-one minor version upgrades are supported. For example, upgrading from **v1.3** to **v1.4** is supported.
* **No skipping**: Skipping versions (e.g., v1.3 to v1.5) is **not** supported. While it might technically work, it is not tested.
* **No downgrades**: Downgrading Omni (e.g., v1.4 to v1.3) is **not** supported. Database migrations applied during an upgrade are generally not revertible.
  Attempting to downgrade will likely result in a failure to start due to the database version being newer than expected, or cause other unexpected behavior.

<Warning>
  **Note on pre-releases**: Use alpha and beta releases at your own risk. These versions are for testing purposes only and can break your installation.
</Warning>

## Preparation

Before performing any upgrade, you **must** read the release notes for the specific version you are targeting.
These notes contain critical information regarding breaking changes, new required flags, and configuration updates.

* **Release Notes**: [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/siderolabs/omni/releases)
* **Changelog**: [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/siderolabs/omni/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md)

### Example: Checking for breaking changes

It is vital to check the **Urgent Upgrade Notes** in the release log for new requirements.

For example, when upgrading from v1.3 to v1.4, a new mandatory flag (`--sqlite-storage-path`) was introduced. There is no default value for this flag.
If a user attempted to upgrade without reading the release notes and adding this flag, Omni would fail to start.

## Applying the upgrade

### Update Omni image

After completing all preparation steps and ensuring your configuration matches the requirements of the new version, the upgrade is performed by updating the container image version.

To apply the upgrade, change the Omni image tag in your deployment manifest (such as `compose.yaml` or your `docker run` script) to the new version string.
A full list of available versions can be found on the **[Omni container packages page](https://github.com/siderolabs/omni/pkgs/container/omni)**.

### Update omnictl

It is heavily recommended to also update `omnictl` to match the version of your Omni server.

Refer to the **[Install and configure omnictl](../getting-started/install-and-configure-omnictl)** guide for instructions on how to update the CLI tool.
