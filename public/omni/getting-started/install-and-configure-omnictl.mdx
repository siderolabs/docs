title: Install and Configure Omnictl
---

`omnictl` is the command-line tool for Omni. It lets you authenticate, manage, and interact with Talos-based Kubernetes clusters through Omni’s centralized API.  

Follow the instructions, to install and configure `omnictl` for your operating system:

## Step 1: Install `omnictl`

You need to install `omnictl` to use Omni from your terminal. 

There are two main ways to do this depending on your setup.

### macOS and Linux (recommended)

If you’re on macOS or Linux, the easiest method to install `omnictl` is through [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/).

This command automatically installs and updates `omnictl`, along with `talosctl` and the `kubectl oidc-login` plugin.

```
brew install siderolabs/tap/sidero-tools
```

### Manual installation

If you prefer a manual setup or aren’t using Homebrew, you can download `omnictl` directly from the Omni dashboard or from the GitHub releases page:

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Omni UI">
Navigate to your Omni dashboard and download the binary for your platform.

![Download Omnictl button](./images/install-and-configure-omnictl-omnictl.png)
</Tab>
<Tab title="GitHub Releases">
Visit the [Omni releases page](https://github.com/siderolabs/omni/releases) to download the latest version of `omnictl`.

Alternatively, you can automatically fetch the latest release using `curl`:

```bash
curl -LO "https://github.com/siderolabs/omni/releases/latest/download/omnictl-$(uname -s | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]')-$(uname -m | sed 's/x86_64/amd64/; s/aarch64/arm64/')"
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

You’ll receive a binary file named according to your platform and architecture (for example, `omnictl-linux-amd64` or `omnictl-darwin-arm64`).

Once downloaded, rename the file, make it executable, and move it into your system path.

For example, see instructions for your operating system below:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title= "macOs and Linux">
    On macOS and Linux:

    ```bash
    mv omnictl-darwin-arm64 omnictl
    chmod +x omnictl
    sudo mv omnictl /usr/local/bin/
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title= "Windows">
    On Windows:

    1. Rename the file in File Explorer or PowerShell:
       ```powershell
       Move-Item omnictl-windows-amd64.exe omnictl.exe
       ```
    2. Move the file to a folder that’s in your `PATH`.
    3. Verify your installation:
       ```powershell
       omnictl version
       ```

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

After this, you’ll be able to run `omnictl` from any terminal window.

## Step 2: Configure `omnictl`

Next, you’ll configure Omni by adding your `omniconfig.yaml` file to your to your default configuration directory.

First, download the `omniconfig.yaml` from your Omni dashboard.

![Download Omnictl button](./images/install-and-configure-omnictl-omnictl.png)

`omnictl` stores its configuration in the standard directory for your operating system:

- **Linux/macOS**: Follows the [XDG Base Directory Specification](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/latest/).

- **Windows**: Uses the `%LOCALAPPDATA%` directory.

<table><thead><tr><th width="119.21484375">OS</th><th>Omniconfig Path</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Linux</td><td><code>\~/.config/omni/config</code></td></tr><tr><td>MacOS</td><td><code>~/Library/Application Support/omni/config</code></td></tr><tr><td>Windows</td><td><code>%LOCALAPPDATA%\omni\config</code>, e.g., <code>C:\Users\<USER>\AppData\Local\omni\config</code></td></tr></tbody></table>

Move or copy the downloaded file to the appropriate path for your OS:

```bash
cp omniconfig.yaml <LOCATION_FOR_YOUR_OS_ABOVE>
```

If you would like to merge the `omniconfig.yaml` with an existing configuration, use the following command:

```bash
omnictl config merge ./omniconfig.yaml
```

You can confirm that the new configuration was added successfully by listing your contexts with this command:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title= "Command">

    ```bash
    omnictl config contexts
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title= "Output">

    ```bash
    CURRENT   NAME         URL
              ...
              example      https://example.omni.siderolabs.io/
              ...
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Step 3: Authenticate and verify

Once installed and configured, the last step is authentication.
This connects your local CLI to your Omni account.

Run the following command to trigger authentication:

```bash
omnictl get clusters
```

A browser window should open automatically for sign-in. If it doesn’t, copy and paste the URL manually:

```bash
BROWSER=echo omnictl get clusters
```

After you complete the sign-in, your credentials are cached locally, and you can start managing your clusters with omnictl.
