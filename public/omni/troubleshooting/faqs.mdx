## What do you need to self-host Omni?

Omni relies on what we call the "Sidero Stack" which consists of the following components:

* Container registry
* Image Factory
* Omni

There are also some supporting components you will need that aren't Sidero specific such as:

* Authentication
* TLS certificates
* Storage for logs and backups

## Is Omni open source?

Omni is licensed under the [Business Source License 1.1](https://github.com/siderolabs/omni/blob/main/LICENSE) which is not an open source license. Omni is a "source available" license which allows you to run Omni in non-production environments without a business agreement with Sidero Labs.

## Can Omni be run air gapped?

Yes, Omni and the rest of the Sidero Stack can be run without internet access.
To do so you will need to run each component within your environment.

Please see documents:

* [Deploy Image Factory on-prem](../self-hosted/run-image-factory-on-prem.mdx)
* [Deploy Omni on-prem](../self-hosted/run-omni-on-prem)
