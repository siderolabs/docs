Omni can integrate with your enterprise SAML provider for authentication and identity management. See also information about [how SAML impacts Omni authentication.](../../security-and-authentication/authentication-and-authorization) Please contact support@siderolabs.com or your account manager to enable SAML on the SaaS version of Omni (N.B. this is only available for Startup tier and above).
If using Omni for non-production workloads, you can [self-host](../../self-hosted/omni-deployment-options) and configure SAML yourself.
