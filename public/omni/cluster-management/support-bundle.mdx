description: Download diagnostic data for troubleshooting Omni-managed clusters.
---

A **Support Bundle** is a downloadable archive that contains detailed diagnostic information about your Omni-managed clusters. It includes data such as cluster and machine statuses, load balancer configurations, Kubernetes and Talos service logs, provisioning details, and network or device information.  

Support Bundles are primarily used for troubleshooting. When something goes wrong, you can share the bundle with the [SideroLabs team](https://www.siderolabs.com/support-and-services/) to help identify and resolve issues.  

While the bundle does **not** include sensitive data like secrets, it may contain elements such as IP addresses, port information, system identifiers, and non-sensitive service logs that provide essential context for debugging.
