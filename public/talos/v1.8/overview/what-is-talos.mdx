Talos Linux is a Kubernetes optimized Linux distro.
It does one thing and it does it better than any general purpose Linux distribution.
Boot it on [bare metal](../getting-started/getting-started) or [in a VM](../platform-specific-installations/cloud-platforms/aws) and have a Kubernetes cluster in minutes.

It runs on your Kubernetes nodes and hosts your workloads.
It also runs the Kubernetes control plane components including the etcd database.
With a single use case and focus it removes complicated and fragile configuration, maintenance, and security vulnerabilities.

It's designed to be as minimal as possible while still maintaining practicality.
For these reasons, Talos has a number of features unique to it:

- API managed
- Immutable file system
- Minimal packages
- Secure by default

Talos can be deployed anywhere you can run a modern Linux kernel.

## API Managed

Talos is managed by a single, declarative gRPC API.
This is the most unique thing about Talos and something Talos users love.

Imagine a Linux distribution that had configuration management built in.
That didn't have fragile cloud-init scripts that wrap `bash` scripts in yaml.

Talos ships with a network API for all configuration and troubleshooting needs.
