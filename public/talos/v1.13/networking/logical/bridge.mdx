A network bridge is a logical network device that connects multiple network interfaces together, allowing them to communicate as if they were on the same physical network segment.
Bridges are commonly used in virtualization and containerization scenarios to allow virtual machines or containers to access the external network through the host machine's network interfaces.

## Configuration

To configure a bridge in Talos Linux, create a [BridgeConfig](../../reference/configuration/network/bridgeconfig) document like:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1alpha1
kind: BridgeConfig
name: bridge.1
links:
    - eno1
    - eno5
stp:
    enabled: true
vlan:
    filtering: false
up: true
addresses:
    - address: 1.2.3.5/32
```

In this example, a bridge named `bridge.1` is created using the physical interfaces `eno1` and `eno5`.
The Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) is enabled to prevent network loops, and VLAN filtering is disabled.
The bridge is also assigned a static IP address of `1.2.3.5/32`.

The `links` field specifies the physical or logical interfaces that are part of the bridge, and [link aliases](./../configuration/aliases) can be used here as well.

Addresses and routes can be configured in the same document as shown in [static link configuration](./../configuration/static).
DHCP can be enabled on the bridge interface as shown in [dynamic link configuration](./../configuration/dynamic).
