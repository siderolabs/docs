A bond (also known as link aggregation or NIC teaming) is a method of combining multiple physical network interfaces into a single logical interface to increase bandwidth and provide redundancy.
When one of the physical interfaces in the bond fails, the traffic is automatically redistributed among the remaining interfaces, ensuring continuous network connectivity.

Bond configuration should match the configuration on the connected switch to ensure proper operation.

## Configuration

To configure a bond in Talos Linux, create a [BondConfig](../../reference/configuration/network/bondconfig) document like:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1alpha1
kind: BondConfig
name: agg.0
links:
    - enp0s2
    - enp0s3
bondMode: 802.3ad
miimon: 100
updelay: 200
downdelay: 200
xmitHashPolicy: layer3+4
lacpRate: slow
adActorSysPrio: 65535
resendIGMP: 1
packetsPerSlave: 1
up: true
addresses:
    - address: 1.2.3.4/24
```

This example demonstrates how to create a bond named `agg.0` using the interfaces `enp0s2` and `enp0s3` with the 802.3ad (LACP) bonding mode.
The bond is configured with various parameters to optimize performance and reliability, such as `miimon`, `updelay`, `downdelay`, `xmitHashPolicy`, and others.

Addresses and routes can be configured in the same document as shown in [static link configuration](./../configuration/static).
DHCP can be enabled on the bond interface as shown in [dynamic link configuration](./../configuration/dynamic).

The `links` field specifies the physical interfaces that are part of the bond, and [link aliases](./../configuration/aliases) can be used here as well.

Bond MTU can be set using the `mtu` field.
Bond by default inherits MAC address from the first link in the `links` list, but a custom MAC address can be set using the `hardwareAddr` field.
