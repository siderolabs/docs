## Appending the certificate authority of MITM proxies

See [Custom Certificate Authorities](../security/certificate-authorities) to append the CA certificate of your corporate proxy to the trusted store.

## Configuring a machine to use the proxy

To configure Talos to use an HTTP or HTTPS proxy, set the appropriate environment variables in the machine configuration:

```yaml
machine:
  env:
    http_proxy: <http proxy>
    https_proxy: <https proxy>
    no_proxy: <no proxy>
```

In proxy-restricted environments, you may also need to configure DNS (`nameservers`) and NTP (`timeservers`) explicitly:

```yaml
machine:
  env:
  ...
  time:
    servers:
      - <server 1>
      - <server ...>
      - <server n>
  ...
  network:
    nameservers:
      - <ip 1>
      - <ip ...>
      - <ip n>
```

If proxy access is required before the machine configuration is applied (for example, during initial boot), provide the proxy settings via [kernel command line arguments](../reference/kernel):

```text
talos.environment=http_proxy=<http-proxy> talos.environment=https_proxy=<https-proxy>
```

DNS and NTP settings can also be managed using their dedicated configuration documents: [ResolverConfig](../reference/configuration/network/resolverconfig) and [TimeSyncConfig](../reference/configuration/network/timesyncconfig) respectively.
