Talos is designed to be secure by default, no SSH, no interactive shell, an API-driven OS, and an immutable filesystem.

Still, there are several additional steps you can take to strengthen the security posture of your cluster.

This checklist highlights the key areas to review and configure when running Talos in production environments.

## Protect secrets and sensitive information

Talos stores certificates, keys, and other sensitive configuration data inside the machine configuration. To keep this material secure, make sure you:

- Encrypt secrets stored in your Talos machine config.

- Limit who has access to machine configuration files, as they contain cluster CA keys and API credentials.

For more details, see:

- [Certificate Authority Rotation](../security/ca-rotation)
- [Generating a Secrets Bundle](../getting-started/prodnotes#step-5%3A-generate-secrets-bundle)
- [Talos Certificate Management](../security/cert-management)
- [`talosctl rotate ca` Reference](../reference/cli#talosctl-rotate-ca)

## Enable disk encryption

Encrypting disks helps ensure that sensitive data cannot be accessed if the underlying hardware is lost or compromised. In Talos, you can enable several layers of disk protection:

- **TPM-backed disk encryption**: Uses the node’s TPM to automatically unlock encrypted volumes during boot.

- **SecureBoot + TPM for verified boot paths**: Confirms that the kernel and operating system haven’t been tampered with before the system starts.

- **Encrypted user volumes**: Protects data stored on node-local disks used by workloads.

You can configure disk encryption manually or manage it centrally through Omni.

For more details, see [Disk Encryption](../configure-your-talos-cluster/storage-and-disk-management/disk-encryption).

## Keep Talos machines up to date

Talos has a small and predictable upgrade surface, and staying current is one of the most effective ways to keep your cluster secure.

Talos follows a regular release cycle: minor releases are published three times per year, patch releases are issued as needed, and security/CVE fixes are delivered according to our SLA for addressing critical vulnerabilities.

Each release may include:

- Kernel security patches

- Container runtime updates

- Enhancements to the Talos API

- CVE and security fixes across the operating system

To stay secure and up to date, make sure you upgrade regularly. You can upgrade individual nodes with:

```bash
talosctl upgrade --nodes <ip>
```

See [Upgrading Talos Linux](../configure-your-talos-cluster/lifecycle-management/upgrading-talos) for more information.

## Enforce pod security controls

Talos secures the operating system, but Kubernetes is responsible for enforcing how your pods behave at runtime. To strengthen workload security, make sure you:

- Enable Pod Security Admission (PSA) with at least baseline protections enabled.

- Apply network policies to control which pods can communicate with each other.

- Restrict privileged workloads, including host namespaces, privileged mode, and hostPath mounts.

- Use read-only root filesystems whenever possible to reduce the risk of tampering.

See [Pod Security](../../../kubernetes-guides/security/pod-security) for more information.

## Review network and firewall configuration

Talos exposes only the minimal set of API-server–controlled ports, but you can further reduce your attack surface by tightening network boundaries. Consider using:

- The Talos ingress firewall to restrict traffic directly at the OS layer,

- Cloud or platform-level firewalls such as security groups or VPC rules,

See [Ingress Firewall](../networking/ingress-firewall) for more information.

## Use secureBoot + verified boot

When your hardware supports it:

- Enable SecureBoot

- Use TPM-backed key storage

This ensures that the kernel, the initramfs, and the OS image have not been modified.

SecureBoot is especially recommended for bare-metal deployments. Refer to the [Secureboot documentation](../platform-specific-installations/bare-metal-platforms/secureboot) for more information.

## Limit API access

The Talos API is the only interface for managing the OS, which means that open or poorly controlled access effectively grants the ability to reconfigure, reboot, wipe, or even replace a node.

To protect your Talos API:

- Limit access to your `talosconfig`, since it contains the credentials required to communicate with the cluster.

- Rotate Talos certificates whenever team members change or access needs to be revoked.

- Avoid embedding Talos API credentials in automation unless you can properly scope and restrict their permissions.

- Prefer short-lived credentials to reduce long-term exposure.

For more detailed guidance on securing Talos API access, see:

- [Certificate Authority Rotation](../security/ca-rotation)
- [Generating a Secrets Bundle](../getting-started/prodnotes#step-5%3A-generate-secrets-bundle)
- [Talos Certificate Management](../security/cert-management)
- [`talosctl rotate ca` Reference](../reference/cli#talosctl-rotate-ca)

## Enable cluster backups and recovery planning

A secure system is one you can recover confidently, which makes backups and disaster-recovery planning an essential part of your security posture. To build real operational resilience, make sure you:

- Create etcd snapshots to capture the state of your cluster. Check out [Talos Backup](https://github.com/siderolabs/talos-backup) to automate taking and storing snapshots of your cluster.

- Store snapshots off-cluster so recovery is possible even if the entire environment is lost.

- Test your disaster-recovery process regularly to ensure it works when you need it most.

- Document the recovery steps so your whole team knows exactly what to do during an incident.

For detailed guidance on recovery and backup workflows, see:

- [Disaster Recovery](../build-and-extend-talos/cluster-operations-and-maintenance/disaster-recovery)
- [etcd Maintenance](../build-and-extend-talos/cluster-operations-and-maintenance/etcd-maintenance)
- [Create Etcd Backups](../../../omni/cluster-management/etcd-backups)

## Monitor and audit

Monitoring and auditing allow you to catch issues early and understand the overall health and behavior of your cluster. With Talos and the wider ecosystem of Kubernetes-native observability tools, you can keep track of:

- Audit logs

- Network flows

- Cluster events

- Changes to Talos nodes (via events / dmesg / API logs)

For setup instructions and deeper guidance, see the following documentation:

- [Audit Logs](../../../omni/cluster-management/using-audit-log)
- [Logging](../configure-your-talos-cluster/logging-and-telemetry/logging)
- [Deploy Metrics Server](../../../kubernetes-guides/monitoring-and-observability/deploy-metrics-server)

Additionally, integrate with tools like [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) and [Grafana](https://grafana.com/) for observability.
