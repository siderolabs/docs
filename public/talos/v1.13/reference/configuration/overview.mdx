Talos Linux machines are fully configured using a single YAML file called the machine configuration.

This file is a multi-document configuration that may contain multiple YAML documents, separated by `---` (three dashes).

Each document represents a partial machine configuration. Talos parses and validates each document independently, then merges them into a single effective configuration before applying it to the machine. Documents are processed sequentially, and later documents take precedence over earlier ones.

At present, most configuration options are defined within the [v1alpha1](./v1alpha1/config) document, which is the only mandatory document in the configuration file.

Configuration documents may be named (contain a `name:` field) or unnamed. Unnamed documents can appear only once in the machine configuration, while named documents can be supplied multiple times, provided each has a unique name.

The `v1alpha1` document uses a legacy structure. All other configuration documents follow this common schema:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1alpha1 # version of the document
kind: NetworkRuleConfig # type of document
name: rule1 # only for named documents
```

> **Note:** YAML treats certain characters,such as `!`, `?`, `*`, and `&`, as part of its own syntax.
> When defining configuration values that include these characters (for example, in selectors or filters like `diskSelector` or `network.interfaces.match` in the [Machine Config](../configuration/v1alpha1/config)), wrap them in quotes (`"..."`) to ensure they are parsed correctly.
