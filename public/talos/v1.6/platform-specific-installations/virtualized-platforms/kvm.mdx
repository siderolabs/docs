Talos is known to work on KVM.

We don't yet have a documented guide specific to KVM; however, you can have a look at our
[Vagrant & Libvirt guide](./vagrant-libvirt) which uses KVM for virtualization.

If you run into any issues, our [slack community](https://taloscommunity.slack.com/) can probably help!
