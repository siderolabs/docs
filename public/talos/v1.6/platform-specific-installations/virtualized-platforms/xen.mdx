Talos is known to work on Xen.
We don't yet have a documented guide specific to Xen; however, you can follow the [General Getting Started Guide](../../getting-started/getting-started).
If you run into any issues, our [slack community](https://taloscommunity.slack.com/) can probably help!
If you are not already a member, you can request access [here](https://inviter.co/sidero-labs-community).
