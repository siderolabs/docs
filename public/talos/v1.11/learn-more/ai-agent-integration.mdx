<VersionWarningBanner />

SideroLabs publishes machine-readable documentation metadata that allows AI agents and developer tools to understand Talos Linux and Omni capabilities programmatically.

These integration points can be used by agent frameworks, MCP-compatible tools, IDE extensions, or custom automation.

## Available integration endpoints

Depending on your tooling and integration model, you can use one or more of the following endpoints.

### The `llms.txt` file

The `llms.txt` file is a structured documentation index.

It lists all the available documentation pages so agents can discover relevant content before answering questions.

You can see the `llms.txt` file at:

```url
https://docs.siderolabs.com/llms.txt
```

### The `skill.md` file

The `skill.md` file is a capability definition that describes supported operations, workflows, architectural constraints, and expected inputs and outputs.

Agents can use this file to understand:

- Supported actions
- Required configuration inputs
- Workflow sequencing
- Operational constraints

You can download the `skill.md` file in your personal Claude skills directory:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills/siderolabs
curl -L https://docs.siderolabs.com/skill.md \
  -o ~/.claude/skills/siderolabs/SKILL.md
```

Restart Claude Code after downloading the file.

**Alternatively**, if your agent supports the [Skills CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/skills), you can install the skill using:

```bash
npx skills add https://docs.siderolabs.com
```

This command loads the SideroLabs capability definition into the agent’s context.

### MCP endpoint

SideroLabs exposes its documentation through a remote Model Context Protocol (MCP) server.

This enables MCP-compatible clients to query the documentation dynamically using the standard MCP interface.

To connect, register the following URL as a remote MCP server in your client configuration:

```url
https://docs.siderolabs.com/mcp
```

**For example:**

To register the SideroLabs documentation as an MCP server in OpenCode or Claude Code:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="OpenCode">

  Add the MCP server configuration to your OpenCode config file located at `~/.opencode/opencode.json`:

  ```json
  {
    "mcp": {
      "siderolabs-docs": {
        "type": "remote",
        "url": "https://docs.siderolabs.com/mcp",
        "enabled": true
      }
    }
  }
  ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Claude code (user-level configuration)">
  Add the MCP server to your [personal Claude configuration](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/settings#configuration-scopes) file located at `~/.claude.json`:
    ```json
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "siderolabs-docs": {
          "type": "remote",
          "url": "https://docs.siderolabs.com/mcp"
        }
      }
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Claude code (project-level)">

  To share the MCP configuration with your team, create or update the `.mcp.json` file in the root of your repository:

  ```json
  {
    "mcpServers": {
      "siderolabs-docs": {
        "type": "remote",
        "url": "https://docs.siderolabs.com/mcp"
      }
    }
  }

  ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

For other MCP-compatible clients, refer to your client’s documentation for instructions on adding a remote server.
