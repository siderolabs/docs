description: 'ZswapConfig is a zswap (compressed memory) configuration document. When zswap is enabled, Linux kernel compresses pages that would otherwise be swapped out to disk. The compressed pages are stored in a memory pool, which is used to avoid writing to disk when the system is under memory pressure.'
