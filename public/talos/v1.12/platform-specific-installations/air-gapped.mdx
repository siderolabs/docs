When running Talos Linux in air-gapped environments, these are the most common challenges:

* providing access to NTP servers for time synchronization;
* acessing container images, including Talos `installer` images, `etcd`, `kubelet`, Kubernetes control plane images, etc.;
* accessing Image Factory for Talos updates and installation;
* running Discovery Service inside the air-gapped environment.

In this guide, we will assume that the environment is completely air-gapped, with no access to the public Internet.
If there is partial connectivity, most of the requirements can be addresses via [pull-through cache](../configure-your-talos-cluster/images-container-runtime/pull-through-cache) and
HTTP proxy configuration.

## Network Configuration

Network configuration in air-gapped environments might require custom settings for DNS and NTP servers.
If running in a virtual environment, the hypervisor might provide time synchronization via [PTP interface](../configure-your-talos-cluster/system-configuration/time-sync) which doesn't require network access.

## Container Images

Talos Linux provides support for redirecting image pull requests to internal registries via [registry mirrors](../configure-your-talos-cluster/images-container-runtime/pull-through-cache) feature.
This feature can be used to redirect all image pull requests to an internal registry which is pre-populated with required images.

See the section on [airgapped registry](../configure-your-talos-cluster/images-container-runtime/image-cache-registry-mirror) for more details.

## Image Factory

See the [guide on running Image Factory in air-gapped environments](../../../omni/infrastructure-and-extensions/self-hosted/deploy-image-factory-on-prem) for more details.

## Discovery Service

Talos Linux by default uses the public Discovery Service at `discovery.talos.dev` to facilitate cluster bootstrapping and node discovery.
In air-gapped environments, it is recommended to run a self-hosted instance of the Discovery Service (requires a license from Sidero Labs).
