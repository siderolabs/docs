## nameservers[]

NameserverConfig represents a single nameserver configuration.

      <th>Description</th>
      <th>Value(s)</th>

    <tr>
      <td>`address`</td>
      <td>Addr</td>
      <td>The IP address of the nameserver.</td>
      <td></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>





## searchDomains

SearchDomainsConfig represents search domains configuration.




<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Field</th>
      <th>Type</th>
      <th>Description</th>

      <td>A list of search domains to be used for DNS resolution.<br /><br />Search domains are appended to unqualified domain names during DNS resolution.<br />For example, if "example.com" is a search domain and a user tries to resolve<br />"host", the system will attempt to resolve "host.example.com".<br /><br />This overrides any search domains obtained via DHCP or platform configuration.<br />The default configuration derives the search domain from the hostname FQDN.</td>
      <td></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>`disableDefault`</td>
      <td>bool</td>
      <td>Disable default search domain configuration from hostname FQDN.<br /><br />When set to true, the system will not derive search domains from the hostname FQDN.<br />This allows for a custom configuration of search domains without any defaults.</td>
