description: 'Layer2VIPConfig is a config document to configure virtual IP using Layer 2 (Ethernet) advertisement. Virtual IP configuration should be used only on controlplane nodes to provide virtual IP for Kubernetes API server. Any other use cases are not supported and may lead to unexpected behavior. Virtual IP will be announced from only one node at a time using gratuitous ARP announcements for IPv4.'
