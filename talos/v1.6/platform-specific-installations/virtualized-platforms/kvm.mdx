Talos is known to work on KVM.

We don't yet have a documented guide specific to KVM; however, you can have a look at our
[Vagrant & Libvirt guide](./vagrant-libvirt) which uses KVM for virtualization.

Also [`talosctl cluster create` with QEMU](../local-platforms/qemu) uses KVM under the hood.

> Note: For the network interface emulation, `virtio` and `e1000` are supported.
