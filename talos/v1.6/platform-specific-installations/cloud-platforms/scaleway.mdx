Talos is known to work on scaleway.com; however, it is currently mostly undocumented.

The process to run a Talos node in Scaleway is as follows :

- Enable block storage on your Scaleway account (Scaleway will only allow snapshots from their block storage, not urls).
- Download the `qcow` image of the Talos version you wish to run.
- Upload it to your block storage using an s3 client or the web interface.
- Configure the `scw` CLI to be able to access your account.
- Create a snapshot from the image :

<CodeBlock lang="sh">
{`
  scw block snapshot import-from-object-storage name=talos-${release_v1_7 } bucket=YOUR-BUCKET key=talos.qcow2 size=10GB 
`}
</CodeBlock>

  This is assuming that you uploaded to a bucket called `YOUR-BUCKET` and a filename of `talos.qcow2`, to be called {`talos-${release_v1_7 }`}.
- Create your instance using the snapshot using the GUI/CLI/OpenTofu etc.
