## Configuring Network Device Using Device Selector

`deviceSelector` is an alternative method of configuring a network device:

```yaml
machine:
  ...
  network:
    interfaces:
      - deviceSelector:
          driver: virtio
          hardwareAddr: "00:00:*"
        address: 192.168.88.21
```

Selector has the following traits:

- qualifiers match a device by reading the hardware information in `/sys/class/net/...`
- qualifiers are applied using logical `AND`
- `machine.network.interfaces.deviceConfig` option is mutually exclusive with `machine.network.interfaces.interface`
- if the selector matches multiple devices, the controller will apply config to all of them

The available hardware information used in the selector can be observed in the `LinkStatus` resource (works in maintenance mode):

```yaml
# talosctl get links eth0 -o yaml
spec:
  ...
  hardwareAddr: 4e:95:8e:8f:e4:47
  busPath: 0000:06:00.0
  driver: alx
  pciID: 1969:E0B1
```

## Using Device Selector for Bonding

Device selectors can be used to configure bonded interfaces:

```yaml
machine:
  ...
  network:
    interfaces:
      - interface: bond0
        bond:
          mode: balance-rr
          deviceSelectors:
            - hardwareAddr: '00:50:56:8e:8f:e4'
            - hardwareAddr: '00:50:57:9c:2c:2d'
```

In this example, the `bond0` interface will be created and bonded using two devices with the specified hardware addresses.
