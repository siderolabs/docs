title: Deploy Your First Workload to a Talos Cluster
weight: 40
description: "Deploy a sample workload to your Talos cluster to get started."

Deploying your first workload validates that your cluster is working properly and that you can schedule, expose, and access applications successfully.

If you donâ€™t have a cluster running yet, check out the [Getting Started](./getting-started) or [Production Notes](./prodnotes) guides to learn how to create one.

To deploy a sample application to your cluster:

1. Run this command to deploy the application and expose it via a NodePort:

    ```bash
    kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/siderolabs/example-workload/refs/heads/main/deploy/example-svc-nodeport.yaml
    ```

1. Verify that your pods and services are running:

    ```bash
    kubectl get pods,services # Lists the deployed pods and services
    ```

1. Create a NODE_IP variable by retrieving an IP address of any one of your nodes:

    ```bash
    NODE_IP=$(kubectl get nodes -o jsonpath='{.items[0].status.addresses[?(@.type=="InternalIP")].address}'; echo)
    ```

1. Retrieve the NodePort assigned to your Service using:

    ```bash
    NODE_PORT=$(kubectl get svc example-workload -o jsonpath='{.spec.ports[0].nodePort}')
    ```

1. Verify your application is running:

    ```bash
    curl http://$NODE_IP:$NODE_PORT
    ```

   And here is your application:
